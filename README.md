Objective:
- The Two Mountains Project aims to develop a comprehensive smoking cessation monitoring system that enables individuals to track their smoking habits and receive support in quitting smoking through a user-friendly Android application paired with Bluetooth connectivity.

Overview:
- This project addresses the challenges of smoking addiction by providing smokers with a digital tool to monitor their smoking patterns, set cessation goals, and receive real-time feedback and encouragement. The system features a Bluetooth-enabled device that captures smoking-related data and syncs it with the Android application, allowing users to visualize their progress.

Workflow:

1. System Design: Conceptualize the architecture of the monitoring system, including hardware components (Bluetooth device) and software features (Android app).
2. Bluetooth Integration: Develop the Bluetooth module to gather data from the monitoring device, such as smoking frequency and duration.
3. Android Application Development: Create an intuitive mobile app that displays user data, tracks progress, offers tips, and provides motivational resources to support smoking cessation.
4. User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX): Design an engaging and user-friendly interface that encourages users to interact with the app regularly and stay committed to quitting.
5. Testing and Feedback: Conduct thorough testing to ensure the reliability of data synchronization and gather user feedback to refine the application for better usability and effectiveness.
